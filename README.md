<h1>Globant's PHP Bootcamp's Drupal App</h1>
<br></br>
<li>Only "modules" and "public" folder will be here, since they are the only ones we must work with.</li>

<li>As the name suggest the modules should be put in "modules" and the content (once we have the app up and running) should be put in "public"</li>
<br></br>
First each one must clone MASTER locally, then with "git checkout -b YOUR BRANCH NAME" a personal branch must be created (with the name of the task) and you should work there.
<br></br>
Once your work is finally done, you push all content with "git push origin YOUR BRANCH NAME) and you move your trello task to "done". Then I will merge all with the DEV branch and once I move the card to "merged" you can do a merge of DEV with your local branch with the rest of the group work.  (yo go to your local branch folder, then "git merge DEV).
<br></br>
<strong>YOU SHOULD NEVER PUSH TO MASTER.</strong>

Cheers.
